# 📚 Course Allocation Using Max Flow (Ford–Fulkerson)

This project assigns **courses to professors** using the **Ford–Fulkerson algorithm** for maximum flow in a bipartite graph. It ensures that:  
- Professors are assigned courses based on their teaching capacity.  
- Courses can be taught by a maximum of two professors.  
- Priority is given to partially filled courses before assigning new ones.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **Ford–Fulkerson max flow** to optimally assign courses.  
- Supports different **professor types** (1-course, 2-course, or 3-course load).  
- Reads input from files (`professors_big.txt`, `courses_big.txt`).  
- Outputs allocation results to `output_big.txt`.  
- Respects constraints: each course can have at most **two professors**.

## 📂 Input File Format
### 1️⃣ `courses_big.txt`
Each line contains a course name.
```
CSE101
CSE102
MTH101
PHY101
```

### 2️⃣ `professors_big.txt`
- **First line**: Three integers → number of professors with load 1, load 2, load 3.
- **Following lines**:  
  - Professor name and number of preferred courses.
  - Next line contains the list of course codes they are willing to teach.

Example:
```
2 2 1
ProfA 2
CSE101 MTH101
ProfB 3
CSE101 CSE102 PHY101
ProfC 1
PHY101
ProfD 2
MTH101 CSE102
ProfE 1
CSE102
```

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Graph Representation**  
   - **Source node (0)** connects to professors (capacities = course load).  
   - Professors connect to preferred courses (capacity = 2).  
   - Courses connect to **sink node (MAX-1)** (capacity = 2).  

2. **Priority Allocation**  
   - Courses already partially assigned are prioritized for the next professor.

3. **Ford–Fulkerson Execution**  
   - BFS finds augmenting paths.  
   - Residual capacities are updated.  
   - Maximum flow determines optimal assignment.

4. **Output**  
   - Writes assigned professor–course pairs to `output_big.txt`.

## ▶️ How to Run
### **Compile & Run**
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o allocation
./allocation
```

### **Expected Output**
- Console shows max flow and debug info.  
- `output_big.txt` contains assignments:
```
ProfA teaches CSE101
ProfB teaches CSE102
ProfC teaches PHY101
...
```

---

## 📊 Example Flow
With the example inputs:
- **Max Flow**: `5` (total assigned courses).
- **Assignments**:
```
ProfA teaches CSE101
ProfB teaches CSE102
ProfC teaches PHY101
ProfD teaches MTH101
ProfE teaches CSE102
```

---

## 📝 Notes
- Adjust `MAX` constant if number of nodes > 500.
- Make sure `professors_big.txt` and `courses_big.txt` are in the **same folder** as the executable.
- For smaller datasets, replace file names inside `main()` with `professors.txt` and `courses.txt`.
